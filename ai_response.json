                "In Python, a function is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. The function body is indented and contains the code to be executed. Here are some key points about defining and using functions in Python:\n\n1. *Basic Syntax: The basic syntax for defining a function is as follows:\npython\ndef function_name():\n    # function body\n    pass\n\n\n2. **Example: Here is an example of a simple function that prints 'Hello, World!':\npython\ndef greet():\n    print('Hello, World!')\n\ngreet()  # Calling the function\n\n\n3. **Arguments: You can pass arguments to a function by placing them inside the parentheses. For example:\npython\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nresult = add_numbers(3, 5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 8\n\n\n4. **Return Keyword: The `return` keyword is used to exit a function and return a value. For example:\npython\ndef square(num):\n    return num * num\n\nresult = square(4)\nprint(result)  # Output: 16\n\n\n5. **Calling a Function: To call a function, use the function name followed by parentheses. If the function requires arguments, pass them inside the parentheses:\npython\ndef greet(name):\n    print(f'Hello, {name}!')\n\ngreet('Alice')  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n\n\n6. **Indentation: Make sure to indent the function body properly. Indentation is crucial in Python to define the scope of the function.\n\n7. **Docstrings*: You can add a docstring to a function to describe its purpose. A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a function:\npython\ndef greet():\n    \"\"\"This function prints a greeting message.\"\"\"\n    print('Hello, World!')\n\n\nBy understanding these concepts, you can define and use functions effectively in Python."
